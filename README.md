Project Description: Simple webserver, that when given a file request and a DOCROOT folder that contains the requested
		     file, will display the requested file and transmit 200 OK.  If the requested file is not in the DOCROOT folder, 
		     then the server will transmit a 404 not found error and display a text message saying the file couldn't be found.  
	             If the file request contains illegal characters, .. or ~, then a 403 Forbidden error is displayed.
